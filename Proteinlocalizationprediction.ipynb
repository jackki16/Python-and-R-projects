Compared to LSTM, there were more layers, which may have contributed to better accuracy and precision and recall. the KMeans didn't perform as well as CNN and LSTM because it is a simple clustering algorithm based on the kmers and it doesn't consider sequential information. Also, LSTM and CNN capture non-linear relationship, but Kmeans does not. Lastly, kmeans is an unsupervised ML technique, while LSTM and CNN are supervised. Hence, it is better suited for the classification task.**"
